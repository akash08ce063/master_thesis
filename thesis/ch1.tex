\chapter{Introduction}

\paragraph{}

Recently, with the dramatically boost of computational power of the current generation CPU hardware, there has been a surge of new interetest in ray tracing as a core rendering algorithm for real-time applications such as video games since it is applicable to push the rendering task to interactive level on powerful computing devices which are easily accessible for a mainstream PC platform. Recently emerged powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) and flexible programming model provides researchers and developers with the ability to have the critical part of the algorithm parallelized and capture many secondary rendering effects such as shadows, refelections and refraction.
