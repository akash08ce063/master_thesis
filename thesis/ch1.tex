\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Structure of the Thesis}	

First of all, an introduction to the problem we will deal with is made. Following the introduction, we provide a theoretic framework for global illumination problem, then we reviewed some of most important approaches including radiosity, Monte Carlo ray tracing and photon mapping. The GPU-based photon mapping technique is highlighted in the last part of chapter two followed by the analysis its advantages and limitations. 

In chapter three, we presented a new GPU photon mapping approach with detailed information on our current implementation. 

The results of our experiment and the analysis of the results are presented in chapter four. 

Finally, in chapter five we come to the conclusion, and discuss the directions for future work.
